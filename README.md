To simplify the configuration on linux os.
You can use linux command curl host:port/path/xx.sh | sh to build your development environment.
The sh file is about shell command when you configure your linux os.
Here I use the raw resource in git to save the configuration and the shell command.
If you have more easy way to configure, welcome to connact me zhu_wan_li@163.com
